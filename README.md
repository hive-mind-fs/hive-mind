We are using Expo to develop with React Native. We are using the “managed workflow” (similar to create-react-app) to minimize complexity.
https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/introduction/managed-vs-bare/.

First, install the command line tools.

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Install project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run the project:

```
npm start
```

On the left panel, click “Run on iOS simulator”

When you make changes to the code, they will automatically show up in the simulator.

To debug in the iOS simulator:

```
⌘ + D
Debug Remote JS
```
