To broadcast an event to all the clients, we can use the io.sockets.emit method.
Now, if we want to send an event to everyone, but the client that caused it (in the previous example, it was caused by new clients on connecting), we can use the socket.broadcast.emit
Emit to particular room, io.to(room).emit('event', 'message')
